Week4 assignment-PyCitySchools
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook file with the csv resource files that analyzes the PyCitySchools homework. 
The report has been saved as a word file.

I have found that the results of Scores by school size/spending/size are slightly differ from the display in the initial starter code.
Talked with the 1:1 tutor and didnt see any issues with coding, can not find the reason.
